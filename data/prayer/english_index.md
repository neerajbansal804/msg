### Sleeping and Waking Up time

## Prayer in morning

```

O Lord ! throughout the entire day

An act of sin, never may an error

that displeases you

And earn my bread, working hard and true

Never hurt anyone's, tender feelings

And be selfless and loving, in my dealings

May I always meditate,

even while walking around

In your memories and longing

May I remain forever bound,

Become worthy of your visions,

I simply plead

You are my soul's, greatest need. 

```

## Prayer before sleeping

```

O Lord ! Throughout the day

Knowingly or unknowingly

If I erred, then I pray

For your forgiveness,

and seek bounties of grace

While sleeping or awake,

to receive gracious rays!

```


### When sitting into meditation

## Prayer before meditation

```

Oh Almighty !

You are the savior

Bestower of grace

Enough excesses, we did face

Shower your benevolence, eternal pure

In pursuit of your love,

No hardships, may we endure

Bequeath such, largesse of grace

And turn everyone, to righteous ways

What one deserve, that must befall

To Whom and how,

You know that all

The ends, the means, is your Wish

supreme.

```

Deeds more noble!
